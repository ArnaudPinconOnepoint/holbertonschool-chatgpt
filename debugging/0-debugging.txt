This is a python code to return the grade for student depending of its result.

"""def graduate:
    grade = ‘Unknown’
    if mark < 50: 
        grade = ‘Not yet successful’ 
    elif mark >=50 and mark <= 60: 
        grade = ‘Pass’ 
    elif mark > 60 and mark <= 75: 
        grade = ‘Credit’ 
    elif mark > 75 and mark < 85: 
        grade = ‘Distinction’ 
    elif mark > 85: 
        grade = ‘High Distinction’ 
    else: 
        grade = ‘Unknown’
    return grade""". 

In this code, there is an issue for specific value.
Error: if mark = 85, the code returns the value 'Unknown'.
Expected result: if mark = 85, the code returns the value 'Distinction'.
Execute the code and fix the problem.
