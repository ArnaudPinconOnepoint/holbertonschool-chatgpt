Here is a code snippet

"""def graduate(mark):
 """Determines the grade based on the mark.

 Args:
 mark (int): The mark obtained by the student.

 Returns:
 str: The grade corresponding to the mark.

 Reasons:
 ValueError: If the mark is outside the range 0-100.
 """
 if mark < 0 or mark > 100:
 raise ValueError("Mark must be between 0 and 100")

 if mark < 50:
 grade = 'Not yet successful'
 elif 50 <= mark <= 60:
 grade = 'Pass'
 elif 61 <= mark <= 75:
 grade = 'Credit'
 elif 76 <= mark <= 85:
 grade = 'Distinction'
 else:
 grade = 'High Distinction'

 return grade"""

Adds all possible test cases to the code to check that the function works correctly.

Reminder :

When given input from 0 to 49, the function should return "Not yet successful."
50-60 “Pass”
61-75 “Credit”
76 – 85 “Distinctions”
86-100 “High distinction”
