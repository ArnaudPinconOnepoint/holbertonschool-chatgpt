Here is a code snippet: 

"""def get_customer_daily_sales(customer_code):
    # Get sql db connection
    sql_con = get_sql_connection()

    # Create a cursor
    cur = sql_con.cursor()

         SELECT
                o.CustomerName,

                SUM(o.OrderTotal) AS DailyTotal
            FROM dbo.Orders AS o
            INNER JOIN dbo.Customers AS c
                on o.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey

            GROUP BY o.CustomerName, CAST(o.OrderDt as DATE);
     """

    # Execute the query
    cur.execute(query)

    # Collect query result

    # Close the connection
    sql_con.close()

    # Return the result
    return result"""

Follow the following steps:

1- Give me the OWASP top 10 list.
2- Review the code testing if it is vulnerable to any OWASP 10 majors. Give me the list of vulnerabilities you found in the code and add an example for each of them.
3- Refactor the code to resolve all vulnerabilities.
